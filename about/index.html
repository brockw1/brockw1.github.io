<h1> {{page.title}} </h1>
<p>My name is Brock Williams, I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln with minors in Math and Music Technology. I am pursuing a career that contributes to creative story telling and helping creatives in their work!
Game development, tools for music creation, computer graphics, HCI, animation and general app development interest me a lot!</p>

<p>When I am not coding, I enjoy board games (and have a growing collection), taple top RPGs like <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>,
  discovering new music, and reading fantasy and science fiction. My top 3 favorite shows recently are <i>Mr. Robot</i>, <i>The Leftovers</i>,
  and <i>Dark</i>.</p>

<p>I work a variety of jobs including being a Teaching Asistant, having a leadership position in the Computer Science Learning Assistant program,
  and working as an AV/IT technician at Pinnacle Bank Arena. Previous to those I was the lead organizer for UNL's NCPA - Science Camp in 2019 and worked
  in IT for UNL College of Business.</p>
