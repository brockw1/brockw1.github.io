  <p>Crystal Cove VR is a project I did with a team of three others for <a href="https://cornhacks.com/">CornHacks 2020</a>.
    For this hackathon we created a VR game in 24 hours which focused on exploring your environment.
    There was an optional theme for this hackathon, environmental sustainability, and so we themed our
    game to be geared towards children to encourage excitement about nature. This was made in Unity with
    SteamVR. Music was created by me in Logic Pro X.</p>

  <p>There are three mini-games in our game: Cave Exploration, Snowball Launcher, and Animal Feeding.
    I worked on the Cave Exploration game which had the player explore a cave using colored flashlights
    that would reveal hidden runes/symbols. The player has to find three hidden runes and enter them on a
    circular lock to complete the puzzle.</p>

  <p>The other two games were made by my other teammates. In Snowball Launcher you have to load your snowball
    launcher and fire at as many snowmen as you can. In Animal Feeding you must feed animals the correct food
    by tossing the food at the animals. In all three of our games, we wanted the player to change the environment
    in some way when they complete each challenge. In Cave Exploration you are rewarded with music that builds as
    you progress, Snowball Launcher reveals hidden gems under a snowy hill, and Animal Feeding restores an abandoned
    and poorly kept forest.</p>

  <p>In addition to working on the Cave Searcher game, I also designed the general layout of the game. We went with a
    snowy, mountainous area. We ensured the game looked expansive but ultimately restricted the player to their campsite and
    surronding mini-games. We did not create any of the 3D models in this game due to time constraints, they were purchased off of
    the Unity Asset Store.</p>

  <p>We learned a lot during this hackathon. We originally had four mini-games planned in our development but due to the time
    constraints the final game was not finished. We wanted to ensure that we had 3 complete games rather than 4 partially complete games.
    Some challenges we ran into, aside from time, was our ongoing struggle managing Unity and GitHub merging issues. There was very high risk
    of overwriting work when we merged in GitHub as Unity Scenes are not handled well by GitHub. We had to ensure we communicated clearly
    and even then we had several times where we had to manually merge and fix issues that arose when merges occured.</p>
