<p>HABIT VR is an award winning Senior Design project that I worked on for my Computer Science degree.
  I worked with 9 other undergraduate students as a developer to create a virtual reality videogame for the University of
  Nebraska Medical Center - Munroe-Meyer Institute. This game is meant to aid in physical therapy
  for children with cerebral palsy. This is a year long project and is still in progress. It is
  being made in Unity with SteamVR.</p>

<p>We were the recipient of the Gold Team Award in the Senior Design program. You can view our project and the other projects on thier website:

  We also had several articles written about our team and project which you can view here:

<p>The premise of our game is the player is a secret agent in training and is tasked with chasing down the nefarious Dr. Sphinx, who
  has set up a series of puzzles that the player must overcome. These puzzle/mini-games put a focus on
  different motions and motor functions, as well as forcing the player to use both hands. We have incorporated
  a 'Therapist UI' for each game that allows the therapist to control various difficulty and accesibility options when someone
  is playing the game. The game has a random-dungeon style design, allowing for replayability and a unique experience for each playthrough.</p>

  <p>I was in charge of a lot of the level design, narrative, and art direction for this game. I worked with my team to make sure we had a
  clear vision for the game. I designed the layout of our tutorial area named the Training Center as well as modeled and animated several assets
  for the game, including Dr. Sphinx himself. I was also in charge of the narrative aspects of the game, so I wrote, recorded, and voice acted for
  most of the story aspects of the game. I also created several audio assets to aid in storytelling as well. Lastly, I designed and implemented two puzzles
  in the game called Ball Roll and Flashlight Searcher which incorporated different upper-body motions and challenges.</p>

  <p>Designing with accesibility in mind was a major aspect and requirement of this project. If you are interested in our process, we made a video going over how we achieved this:</p>
