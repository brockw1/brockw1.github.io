<h1>HABIT VR</h1>

<p>HABIT VR is my Senior Design (Capstone) project for my Computer Science degree.
  I am working with 9 other undergraduate students to create a game for the University of
  Nebraska Medical Center - Munroe-Meyer Institute which is meant to aid in physical therapy
  for children with cerebral palsy. This is a year long project and is still in progress. It is
  being made in Unity with SteamVR.</p>

<p>The premise of our game is the player is tasked with chasing down the nefarious Dr. Sphinx, who
  has set up a series of puzzles that the player must overcome. These puzzle/mini-games put a focus on
  different motions and motor functions, as well as forcing the player to use both hands. We have incorporated
  a 'Therapist UI' for each game that allows the therapist to control various difficulty and accesibility options when someone
  is playing the game. We are also implementing a random-dungeon-generation aspect to the game to help ensure replayability</p>

<p>I have worked on a Rolling Ball game in which the player must rotate their wrists to rotate platforms to ensure a ball rolls
  to its goal. I also worked on level designing our tutorial area, or Training Center. This includes room layouts and decoration.
  Most of our assets used in this project were aquired from the Unity Asset Store. There are few exceptions including
  <a href="/projects/3D/sphinx">Dr. Sphinx</a> and a few other custom components, which were made by me in Cinema4D or by various
  team members in Unity using ProBuilder.</p>
