  <p>Here is a collection of other 3D projects & animations I have made.
    All projects on this page were modeled or animated in Cinema 4D.</p>

  <h1>Myconid</h1>
  <img src="/images/Myconid.png" width="500">
  <p>March 2019. My first character sculpting project. This bust is a mushroom person, based off of
  Myconids from <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> as well as Groot from <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>. I learned
  a lot about mapping and sculpting (and the struggles that come along with that).</p>

  <h1>this is mud.</h1>
  <img src="/images/Mud.png" width="500">
  <img src="/images/mud-drawing.jpg" width="500">
  <p>February 2019. For my Computer Graphics course we were challenged to model a creature based off of
    a child's drawing. This was the result of that.</p>

  <h1>Retro Mouse</h1>
  <img src="/images/RetroMouse.png" width="500">
  <p>January 2019. One of my very first 3D modeling projects for my Computer Graphics course. We were
    given an old computer mouse, and tasked with recreating it.</p>

  <h1>Sword and Stone</h1>
  <img src="/images/SwordandStone.png" width="500">
  <p>January 2019. Another very early 3D modeling project for my Computer Graphics course.</p>

  <h1>Apple Charger</h1>
  <img src="/images/AppleCharger.png" width="500">
  <p>January 2019. The very first 3D modeling project we had for my Computer Graphics course. We were shown
    easy ways to make something simple look very realistic, using HDRI lighting.</p>
