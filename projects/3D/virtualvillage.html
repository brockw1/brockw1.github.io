  <h1>Virtual Village</h1>

  <p>Virtual Village was my final project for ARTS 291Q - Introduction to 3D Computer Graphics.
  In this final project, we were tasked with creating and animating a floating island that had at
  least one character and structure on the island.</p>

  <p>Virtual Village takes inspiration from the many artifacts of early 2000s web pages. I looked to
    imagine what world might exist in the "Virtual Desktop Pets" and variety of GIFs that plagued early
    personal blogs of the early 2000s. The characters and world I ended up with also takes inspiration from
    games like Animal Crossing. I wanted the world to look toy-like and so I made sure materials reflected
    plastic and vinyl toy sets. I modeled, textured, and animated in Cinema4D and edited the final video in
    Adobe After Effects.</p>
