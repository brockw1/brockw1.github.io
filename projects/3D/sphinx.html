  <p>Dr. Sphinx is the evil villain in the <a href="/projects/recent/habit">HABIT VR</a> project
    I am currently working on for my Senior Design project. In this project,
    he escapes from his prison cell and sends the player on a chase, forcing them
    to solve the many puzzles Dr. Sphinx makes if the player wants to catch him.</p>

  <p>I modeled Dr. Sphinx in Cinema 4D and then exported the model to be used in Unity.
    Our HABIT VR team wanted a villain that was simple in design to make animation
    easier to implement as many team members have little experience in animation. I took
    inspiration from other villains across video games such as Dr. Neo Cortex from the <i>Crash
    Bandicoot</i> series and Waluigi from the <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> series.</p>

    <p>In addition to the Dr. Sphinx model, I also modeled some custom assets for a variety of
      puzzles in the <a href="/">HABIT VR</a> project. I will include some of these below as they
      are made.</p>
