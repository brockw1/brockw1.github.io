title: "Binging Game Dev Videos"

I have recently been binging various talks and videos about game development. I thought I would make a post of the videos I have really liked recently.

The Game Developers Conference (GDC) Youtube channel is a gold mine for me. I am constantly going down the GDC rabbit hole whenever I see one in my recommended feed. Unity's Youtube has been another great place to learn as I work in Unity. I also heavily enjoy a variety of independent creators' channels that talk about their thoughts and experiences with game development.

<h2>The Art of Firewatch</h2>

*The Art of Firewatch* is a really interesting talk from Jane Ng, one of the artists for *Campo Santo*. It is a fascinating talk about taking a very stylized art direction and how that translates into game mechanics and design.

I already loved this game and how it uses its environment to weave the story and mystery, so I was very happy to watch this look at how they accomplished such an atmospheric game.

<h2>No Time, No Budget, No Problem: Finishing The First Tree</h2>

*No Time, No Budget, No Problem: Finishing The First Tree* is another great GDC talk from David Wehle. I admittedly do not know a ton about the marketing side of game development and I think David does a great job at explaining what he needed to get done to finish his game and market it. Lots of valuable information about both! I really like his advice of never having a "0% day" and I also liked his advice of not being afraid to use pre-made assets in your games.

<h2>8-bit Music Theory: My Favourite Musical Moments of the 2010s</h2>

Lastly is a video from 8-bit Music Theory, which is a great channel that breaks down various music theory topics from a variety of games and is pretty funny about it too (in a music nerd kind of way). In *My Favourite Musical Moments of the 2010s*, 8-bit takes us through a celebration of music in video games from the past decade. My understanding of music theory probably caps out at a college freshman level of understanding but his videos are still very approachable.

I will probably make more posts about game dev videos, mainly so I will have a place I can find them again but also because I think they are worth sharing.
