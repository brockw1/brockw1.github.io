For my Music Technology Capstone project, I am making a small game that combines the content I learned in my Music Technology minor and how it can connect to my major.

I have broken the project down into Sprints, and for this Sprint, one of my tasks is nailing down the character design of the player character, who I am calling Squire for the time being.

He has gone through several iterations already and I may tweak the design slightly but I wanted to share some of my progress. Squire is a socially anxious sidekick set in a high-fantasy world.

My first attempt at creating Squire, I wanted to keep his design very simple. I gave him a cape to represent that he traveled or adventured but other than that I wanted to convey that his "default" expression was anxious. I knew he needed at least one more feature that would help add character. Initial feedback from peers was that they looked like sad Anpanman (which I cannot unsee now). They also thought a flower on the Squire's head could add some uniqueness to his design.

With that feedback in mind I continued to iterate. I liked the idea of having a flower, it was playful but could also reflect how delicate the Squire was meant to be. I had the flower designed but now the Squire looked like a Wiggler from the Super Mario Bros. Series. So instead, I removed the flower and tried adding ears, giving the Squire more of an donkey appearance. I also added some simple materials with color. I wasn't super happy with these changes and decided to rethink again.

I went back to the flower-head idea and decided to change his face a bit to make Squire more of my own. I made his eyebrows more neutral which makes him appear less sad but still an underlying expression of discomfort. I elongated his nose to move away from Wiggler territory, and changed his proportions a bit so he was a bit taller and not quite as wide. Finally, I edited the materials to more reflect my art style. I added floating hands as I think this will probably be easiest for me, as I only have a small amount of character animating experience.

This is the current state of Squire. I have done some more minor tweaking to materials since this last render but I am happy with his design. I do not have to worry about animating him in this Sprint but I may have to go back and tweak if his model becomes difficult to rig/animate. I'm still learning a lot about 3D modeling and hope to keep learning as I continue with this project.
